## Creating accounts (day 1)
- GSuite - we use GSuite for email, google docs, and calendar.  You should have received an invitation to create an @dhis2.org account.

- Dhis2.org Slack - we use Slack for real-time communication across the entire team.  You should receive an invitation on your DHIS e-mail.

- GitHub - we use the [DHIS2 organization](http://github.com/dhis2) on GitHub for source code management.  You can send your github username to Austin McGee and he will add you to the org.

- Jira (dhis2.atlassian.net) - Create an account yourself using your DHIS 2 email as a username by clicking “Sign up”. Let Stian Sandvold know about your account creation and your account privileges will be upgraded.

- Community of Practice (CoP) - we host a community forum at [community.dhis2.org](https://community.dhis2.org) where the global DHIS2 implementer, user, and developer communities.  You should be able to sign up for an account with your @dhis2.org email address and let Al-Gassim Sharaf Addin know so he can give you the “staff” role.

## Meeting the team (Weeks 1-2)
During the first two weeks, we will set up several meetings with you and key people to know in the DHIS2 global team.  You’ll also be invited to a few recurring meetings with your own teams.  Keep an eye on your new calendar for invites!

## Getting to know DHIS2 (self-paced, weeks 1-4)
Here are some links with self-paced learning materials that you can try to find time for during your first few weeks. There’s a lot of material here, and some of it can be quite dense, so feel free to take your time and work through it over several weeks.

To get familiar with who we are and what we do at DHIS2, browse through the [DHIS2 Global Team Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1gFgFYJAsA8OPDtB1wqHJSXNycoji2bSgkY4UL8QxWvM/edit).

[DHIS2 Beyond the Software](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wEpNX045aUa83faWygXHqsUV7giQv-_i/view?usp=sharing) is an introductory video from our recent All-Developer Week which discusses the history of DHIS2 and the relationship with research and implementation (specifically our regional HISP groups).

To learn more about the product we’re building you can follow [the online self-paced fundamentals courses](https://academy.dhis2.org/courses) aimed at new users. It will give you some good background about the software itself and the broader picture of functionality offered. You will learn the basics of how users configure DHIS2, and what they use it for. This will likely take some time and so feel free to spread it out over your first month.  The course requires you to register, so please let me know if you have any issues.

## Additional Resources
You can also check out the full schedule from the [2022 All-Devs Workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8d5B2an9l8OgrdrY19jWcKZrlUowpy-AadAhlHc65A/edit#heading=h.gevn8z1idrbj) with some slides and recordings, feel free to work your way through any relevant sessions.

On our YouTube channel there is also [a longer version of the DHIS2 history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lIKeOm4Nco), from Professor Jørn Braa who has led the DHIS2 project here at the University of Oslo from the beginning in the 1990s. Lars Øverland also recently presented a [seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt428IN2kPM) on lessons learned over 20 years leading the DHIS2 software team from a software design and development perspective which can be insightful for our design processes.

[This webinar](https://youtu.be/kj1ZtHtPKz0) describes how DHIS2 is being adopted for covid vaccine efforts which can help to understand the impact of the work we do.

There are many videos on the [DHIS2 YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Dhis2Org) besides those that I have linked here. Feel free to take a look at anything that looks of interest, so that you can get a sense of the broader platform. The videos run the gamut from detailed training for server admins, to presentations of external apps developed by partners, to specific functionality demos.
